# Projects using Tensorflow js

Image recoginition then text to speech

- Used pretrained Mobilenet model to classify (recoginize) an image
- Then, used Google text-to-speech API to convert classified image label to speech


Voice commands recoginition

- Trained a DNN by taking samples of voice notes for 'left', 'right' and 'noise' classes.
- Then, Used DNN to take continuous voice input and move slider based on what user says i.e., move slider 'left' or 'right' 

Object detection

- Used pretrained Coco SSD's model object detection


Pose detection

- Pose detection using PoseNet Model
- Used transfer learning to train custom model by providing train samples


Handwritten digits recoginition

- Trained CNN model for handwritten digits recoginition using MNIST dataset.
- UI shows plots of train and validation loss, accuracy, confusion matrix. 


Drawing with Voice - Speech recognition

- Draw with commands 'up', 'down', 'left' and 'right'
